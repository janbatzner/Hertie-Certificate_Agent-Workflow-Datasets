## Subject: Application for Residence Permit — Student Visa

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to formally submit my application for a residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) for the purpose of study in Germany.

### My Personal Information

My name is **Thi Saleh**, and I was born on **February 3, 1969**, in **Tunis, Tunisia**. I am female and have brown eyes. I was previously married but am now divorced (geschieden). I identify as Catholic.

### Entry and Intended Stay

I arrived in Germany on **November 24, 2019**, with the intention of pursuing academic studies. I am seeking permission to remain in the country for **1 year** initially, with the possibility of extension depending on my academic progress.

### Health Insurance Status

I must honestly inform you that I **do not currently have health insurance** (Keine). I understand this is a requirement and am actively seeking affordable options. I have contacted several insurance providers and expect to have coverage within the next two weeks. I kindly request that my application not be rejected solely on this basis.

### Legal History

I can confirm the following:

- I have **no criminal record** in Germany or abroad (Rechtsverstöße: Nein)
- I have **never been deported** from any country (Bereits abgeschoben: Nein)

### Financial Situation

I am **not receiving any social benefits** (Sozialleistungen: Nein) and intend to support myself through a combination of personal savings and part-time work permitted under the student visa conditions.

### Health Status

I have **no known medical conditions** that would affect my ability to study or work.

### Integration Course

I have **not enrolled** in an integration course (Teilnahme an Integrationskurs: Nein) as my German language skills are already at a sufficient level for university admission. I completed a German language preparatory course at the Goethe-Institut in Tunis before my arrival.
